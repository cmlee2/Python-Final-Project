# Python-Final-Project

I want to build a personal finance API that allows users to budget and save at a rate suitable for their goals. It will have methods to:
- Allow individuals to track their income and expenses
- Categorize transactions and create breakdowns on what where spending is centralized
- Save recurring payments and costs
- Filter based on transaction type
- Track savings to ensure savings rate are suitable for their investment goals
    - I would like to have savings guides that return stock market info for people to see change over time (i.e YoY increase/decrease)
    - Additionally, I want to have a simulator that would allow people see how much money will grow over a time period
        - For example, display how much investing 10k in 2022 would look in the current day. I want it to visualize strategies such as dollar cost averaging and such.

I would start by finding an API that allows for pulling in real time market data. Afterwards, I want to work on creating a suitable format for allowing user input and tracking.
